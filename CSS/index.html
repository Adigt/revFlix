      <h4>Summary</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="article 1">
      <p>Directed by <span>Luis Valdez</span>, <span>La Bamba</span> is a
      biographical film, loosely based on the real life of a teenage Mexican
      migrant, <span>Ritchie Valens</span> who achieved an overnight
      <span>Rock 'n' Roll </span> success in 1958, as one of the first Latinos
      in the industry. From living in refugee camps in the country to trailer
      van in the city, from playing at a garage party to going on tours with the
      very best, from nothingness to living the <span>American Dream</span>, the
      psth is all-set for 17-year-old Ritchie Valens.</p>    
    </div>
    <div class="section 2"><h4>Plot Elements</h4></div>
    <div class="article 2">
      <ul>
        <li>Sibling Rivalry</li>
        <p>
          The ups and downs in the relationship between two brothers with
          entirely different personalities. Ritchie's elder brother tries to
          provide for him yet messes up things. However, whenever the need
          arises Ritchie relies on him as his best friend and companion. The
          overnight success of Ritchie's music career while him being the black
          sheep of the family has adverse effects on his mind. The loving
          brother gets jealous and messes up in a public gathering, however
          Ritchie forgives him afterwards.

        <li>Art before Commercial success</li>
        <p>
          Back in the late 50's when people struggled with their ethnicity in
          Hollywood, Ritchie Valens takes a bold move with his
          <span>rock 'n' roll version of La Bamba</span> a Spanish folk song.
          While he did accept the stage name given by his manager to hide his
          ethnicity, he did not let it hamper the making of this very song
          regarded as the second best of his career.
        </p>
        <li>Dreams and Nightmares</li>
        <p>
          While Ritchie Valens achieves his
          <span>rock 'n' roll dream</span> overnight, he also suffers from the
          nightmares of a plane crash which haunts him since his early days.
          <br />
          In February 1959, while on their Chicago tour, their private plane
          crashes north of Clear Lake claimed the lives of rock 'n' roll
          musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, J. P. "The Big Bopper"
          Richardson and pilot Roger Peterson. <br />
          Fate catches up with the rising sensation.

      In my opinion, the movie makes you feel present in the authentic late 50's
      American life, while reciting the tale of overnight success, a must watch
      for all the dreamers out there.
